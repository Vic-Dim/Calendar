Little steps of how to run your application.

First you must have Python 3 and PIP installed from Python 3 version of the language. To check if you have already installed them on your machine, type these commands one by one:

```
python3 --version
pip3 --version
```

If you have them, pass the next commands, but if you have not them, install them with these comands, again typed one by one. Important: after every new command you may need to type your password for using your operational system.

```
sudo apt install python3.9
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

It is good to upgrade your Python and PIP version to the newest with:

```
sudo apt update
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

The next thing your should do is to install the virtual environment. For that purpose you will need to type this command:

```
pip3 install virtualenv
```

For the installation of the project, naviaget to the project folder and pass the first command from below oif you are already in it. The name of the folder is "Calendar" but after downloading the folder you will see the name "Calendar-master". Then you must type the next commands:

```
cd Calendar-master/
sudo apt-get install libffi-dev
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

After this enter these commands for creating the base of data. You have to go in the Python console mode, type the needed commands and then exit from the Python console:

```
python3
from main import db
db.create_all()
